# **AI Teacher Agent Cluster – Completion Checklist**

## **Core Build (MVP)**

### **1. Repo, Backend & Frontend Setup**

* [ ] Create and initialize GitHub repo
* [ ] Set up Python FastAPI backend (REST API server)
* [ ] Set up React + Next.js dashboard with voice controls

### **2. LLM & Agent Integration**

* [ ] Integrate OpenAI API (GPT-4.1 or GPT-4o)
* [ ] (Optional) Integrate Claude API (as fallback or comparison)
* [ ] Implement agent classes/modules:

  * [ ] Discovery Agent
  * [ ] Simplification Agent
  * [ ] Teaching Agent
  * [ ] Clarification Agent
  * [ ] Engagement Agent
  * [ ] Context Memory Agent
  * [ ] Voice Processing Agent

### **3. Agent Workflow Orchestration**

* [ ] Chain agents together in workflow:

  * User prompt → Discovery → Simplification → Teaching → Clarification → Engagement
* [ ] Use LangChain or CrewAI for multi-agent orchestration
* [ ] Implement context/memory handling (file, ChromaDB, or Pinecone)

### **4. Prompt Engineering**

* [ ] Write specialized prompt templates for each agent
* [ ] (Optional) Add few-shot examples to improve output quality

### **5. Voice I/O Implementation**

* [ ] Integrate browser Web Speech API (STT) for voice input
* [ ] Integrate browser SpeechSynthesis API (TTS) for voice output
* [ ] (Optional) Integrate cloud-based TTS/STT (e.g., ElevenLabs, Google TTS)

### **6. End-to-End Test & Iteration**

* [ ] Test full flow: Text/voice input → agent chain → text/voice output
* [ ] Fix bugs and edge cases in conversation flow
* [ ] Iterate on prompt quality and agent handoff
* [ ] Gather user feedback and improve UX

---

## **Memory/Storage**

* [ ] Implement conversation context and user progress storage (ChromaDB, Pinecone, or local file/DB)

---

## **Dev Tools & Ops**

* [ ] Set up code management and collaboration (GitHub)
* [ ] Set up basic project/task management (Notion/Trello or similar)

---

## **(Optional) Model & Deployment Enhancements**

* [ ] (Optional for POC) Experiment with local LLMs via Ollama/LM Studio
* [ ] (Optional) Prepare for cloud deployment (e.g., scalable backend)
* [ ] (Optional) Set up AWS SageMaker or Hugging Face for fine-tuning if needed

---

## **Documentation & Resources**

* [ ] Document architecture, agent roles, tech stack, and usage
* [ ] Provide quickstart/readme instructions in repo
* [ ] List and link references/resources for APIs and frameworks used

---

## **Potential Expansions (After MVP)**

* [ ] Advanced dashboard features (analytics, user stats, etc.)
* [ ] Adaptive learning paths and personalized progress tracking
* [ ] Visual aids: real-time diagrams, code snippets, etc.
* [ ] Cloud backend with load balancing/scalability
* [ ] Agent/model fine-tuning (SageMaker, open-source LLMs)
* [ ] Analytics dashboard for usage and learning metrics
