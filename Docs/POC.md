# **AI Teacher Agent Cluster — Proof of Concept (POC) Document** #
---

## **1. Concept Overview**
**Goal:**
Build a modular, voice-enabled AI Teacher Agent capable of teaching any subject (math, science, programming, etc.) in a human-like conversational flow. The agent cluster processes user prompts, simplifies complex topics, delivers lectures, answers follow-up questions, quizzes the learner, and adapts to their needs—all through natural language and optionally with voice input/output.

---

## **2. System Architecture**
### **A. High-Level Flow**
1. **User Prompt:** Via web dashboard (text or speech).
2. **Agent Cluster:** Multi-stage processing (Discovery → Simplification → Teaching → Clarification → Engagement).
3. **Output:** Displayed in dashboard and/or played via TTS.

## **3. Agent Roles**
| Agent | Responsibility |
| ----- | ----- |
| Discovery Agent | Understands and clarifies the user’s requested topic |
| Simplification Agent | Breaks complex topics into simple, teachable segments |
| Teaching Agent | Delivers the main explanation/lecture |
| Clarification Agent | Answers follow-ups, handles interruptions, ensures comprehension |
| Engagement Agent | Generates quizzes, asks questions, keeps the learner engaged |
| Context Memory Agent | Tracks conversation history and learning progress |
| Voice Processing Agent | Handles speech-to-text and text-to-speech for full voice I/O |

## **4. Proposed Tech Stack**
### **Frontend**
- **HTML/CSS/JS:** For initial dashboard UI
- **Optional Frameworks:** React or Vue for advanced features
- **Web APIs:**
    - Web Speech API (in-browser STT)
    - SpeechSynthesis API (in-browser TTS)
### **Backend**
- **Python + FastAPI:** REST API server, agent orchestration
- **LangChain or CrewAI:** For multi-agent workflow/orchestration
- **OpenAI API (GPT-4.1/4o):** Main LLM for prompt-based agent reasoning and output
- **Claude API (optional):** For alternative LLM responses
### **Memory/Storage**
- **ChromaDB (local)** or **Pinecone (cloud):** For storing conversation context, user memory, etc.
### **Voice Processing**
- **Browser APIs:** (for prototype, local use)
- **Cloud TTS/STT:** (e.g., ElevenLabs, Google TTS) if needed for more natural voices
### **(Optional) Custom Model Training**
- **Open-source LLMs:** (Llama 3, Mistral, etc.) via Ollama or LM Studio for local model experimentation (not required for first POC)
- **AWS SageMaker:** Only if you need to fine-tune/train models later
### **Dev Tools**
- **GitHub:** Code management
- **Notion/Trello:** Project/task management

## **5. Development Approach & Steps**
### **A. MVP / Prototype Steps**
1. **Setup**
    - Set up local Python FastAPI server
    - Create simple HTML/JS UI (input, output, play/record buttons)
2. **LLM Integration**
    - Use OpenAI GPT-4.1 API for all agent responses
    - Engineer custom prompts for each agent role (see below)
3. **Agent Workflow**
    - Implement each agent as a Python function/class/module
    - Chain agents: user prompt → Discovery → Simplification → Teaching → Clarification → Engagement
    - Add context/memory as needed (local file/DB)
4. **Voice I/O**
    - Add Web Speech API (STT) for voice input
    - Add SpeechSynthesis API (TTS) for output
5. **Testing & Iteration**
    - Run local end-to-end: text/voice in → agent chain → text/voice out
    - Iterate on prompts and flow based on output quality

### **B. Example Agent Implementation**
```python
class DiscoveryAgent:
    def run(self, prompt):
        # LLM prompt: "Identify the main topic and user's learning goal in: {prompt}"
        pass
class SimplificationAgent:
    def run(self, topic):
        # LLM prompt: "Break this topic down for a beginner: {topic}"
        pass
class TeachingAgent:
    def run(self, simplified_topic):
        # LLM prompt: "Act as a teacher and give a detailed, engaging explanation for: {simplified_topic}"
        pass
# ... Add ClarificationAgent, EngagementAgent, etc.
```
---

### **C. Example Frontend-Backend Flow**
1. User enters or speaks a prompt
2. Frontend sends to `/teach`  endpoint
3. Backend runs through agent cluster, gets response(s)
4. Frontend displays text, plays TTS if needed
5. User can ask follow-up, triggering ClarificationAgent
---

## **6. Prompts/Training Approach**
- **Prompt Engineering:** Each agent uses specialized, carefully crafted prompts to guide LLM output.
- **Few-shot examples:** Optionally provide examples of great teaching/clarification in prompts.
- **Local fine-tuning:** Only if moving to open-source LLMs (advanced, not needed for MVP)
---

## **7. Next Steps Checklist**
- [ ] Set up repo & FastAPI backend
- [ ] Create HTML/JS frontend (basic dashboard)
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI API and implement agent classes/functions
- [ ] Develop initial prompt templates for each agent
- [ ] Add basic context/memory storage (file, ChromaDB, or Pinecone)
- [ ] Implement browser-based STT/TTS
- [ ] Test agent flow end-to-end
- [ ] Gather feedback, iterate on agent prompts and UX
---

## **8. Potential Expansions (After MVP)**
- Advanced dashboard UI (React/Vue, user stats, etc.)
- Adaptive learning paths and progress tracking
- Real-time visual aids (diagrams, code snippets)
- Scalable backend (cloud deployment, load balancing)
- Custom agent fine-tuning (using SageMaker or Hugging Face)

# **Summary**
This POC aims to create a highly modular, agent-driven AI teaching assistant, leveraging the power of GPT-4.1, Python, FastAPI, LangChain, and browser voice APIs to deliver an interactive learning experience for any subject. The architecture is scalable and ready for both rapid prototyping and future upgrades (multi-agent orchestration, fine-tuned models, cloud deployment).
